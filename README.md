## Four Key Steps of EDA
### 1️- Data Profiling  
- Understanding the dataset structure  
- Checking data types, missing values, and summary statistics  
- Identifying potential issues such as outliers and inconsistencies  

### 2️- Data Cleaning  
- Handling missing values (imputation or removal)  
- Removing duplicates and inconsistencies  
- Standardizing formats for better analysis  

### 3️- Univariate Analysis  
- Analyzing single variables independently  
- Generating summary statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.)  
- Visualizing distributions using histograms, box plots, and KDE plots  

### 4️- Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis  
- Exploring relationships between two or more variables  
- Using scatter plots, heatmaps, and correlation matrices  
- Identifying trends and dependencies between variables  
## How to Use  
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook using:  

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "EDA explain template.ipynb"
   ```
   
3. Run the cells step by step.

## Conclusion 
This template provides a structured approach to performing EDA efficiently. Feel free to modify and expand it based on your dataset and analysis goals.
